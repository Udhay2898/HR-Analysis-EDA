**Project Objective:**

  The primary objective of this data analysis project is to understand and identify patterns, trends, and factors that influence employee retention and satisfaction within a company. By analyzing key variables such as satisfaction level, last evaluation, number of projects, average monthly hours, time spent at the company, work accidents, employee turnover, and promotions over the last 5 years, we aim to uncover insights that can guide decision-making in HR management, employee engagement strategies, and organizational improvements.

**Excel/Google Sheets:**

**Data Exploration:**
  Use Excel or Google Sheets to perform basic data analysis, such as calculating averages, counts, and percentages, to gain a foundational understanding of the dataset.

**Live Data Dashboard:**
  Create an interactive dashboard that updates in real-time to showcase key metrics, trends, and insights. This dashboard will enable stakeholders to easily interpret the data and make informed decisions based on the most current information available.

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**

**Pandas:** 
  Use Pandas to load the dataset, handle missing values (if any), and perform basic data cleaning. We will also create new features or modify existing ones to better analyze the data.

**Numpy:** 
  Utilize Numpy for numerical operations, such as scaling, normalizing, or creating arrays for mathematical calculations.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

**Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly :**
  These tools work together to provide a comprehensive exploration of the data, helping to uncover key patterns, trends, and insights. This thorough analysis is essential for making informed decisions and gaining a deeper understanding of the underlying factors within the dataset.
**Descriptive Statistics:** 
  Analyze the central tendencies and dispersion of the data using Pandas to generate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation).

**Correlation Analysis:** 
  Evaluate the relationships between different variables to identify which factors might be strongly associated with employee turnover or satisfaction levels.

**Key Areas of Analysis:**

**Employee Satisfaction vs. Turnover:** 
  Investigate how employee satisfaction levels correlate with turnover, examining if lower satisfaction leads to higher attrition.

**Impact of Workload:** 
  Analyze the impact of the number of projects and average monthly hours on employee satisfaction and turnover, identifying any patterns that suggest overwork or underwork.

**Time Spent at Company:** 
  Assess how the time spent at the company influences the likelihood of an employee leaving, and whether promotions or lack thereof affect this.

**Work Accidents:** 
  Explore the role of work accidents in employee turnover, determining if safety concerns might be a contributing factor to attrition.

**Promotion Analysis:** 
  Analyze the promotion patterns over the last 5 years, investigating how promotions relate to employee satisfaction and retention.

**Conclusion and Recommendations:**
  Based on the analysis, provide actionable recommendations aimed at improving employee satisfaction and reducing turnover. Suggestions may include optimizing workload distribution, enhancing employee evaluation processes, implementing safety measures, or refining promotion strategies.
